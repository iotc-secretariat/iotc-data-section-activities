## Purpose

To present a summary of fisheries data reported by CPCs present at the workshop (Eastern region)

## Contents:

- summary of data status
- Active fishing vessels
- New fishery code - example
- Availability of annual retained catch
- Availability of geo-reference catch and effort
- Availability of size frequency

---

## summary of data status

- Fisheries are of various type, with mainly coastal fisheries, although not all CPCs report information for the coastal fisheries

- Information on industrial vessels are available in details. Whereby, mainly longliners are operating in the Eastern Indian, both deep-freezing, and fresh longline vessels


- Spatial catches are well available for industrial fisheries

---

## summary of data status...CONT

- Spatial catches for coastal fisheries are either not provided or low coverage in some cases, with only `r round((((CA_RAW_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & FISHERY_TYPE_CODE =="ART", sum(CATCH)])/(RC_RAW_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & FISHERY_TYPE_CODE =="ART", sum(CATCH)]))*100),2)`% of total retained catches.


- Spatial catches for the industrial longline are more representative of the retained catches reported for longline, although not all CPCs reported raised spatial catch.

- Spatial catches for the industrial purse seine, on the other hand, are far less representative of the retained catches reported for longline, at `r round((((CA_RAW_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & GEAR_CODE =="PS", sum(CATCH)])/(RC_EST_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & GEAR_CODE =="PS", sum(CATCH)]))*100),2)`% of the total catch purse seine catch reported. 

---

- Spatial catch and effort information of small scale fisheries, particularly handline and coastal longline indicated that fisheries operated beyond their national jurisdiction 

- Size frequency data are available for several fisheries, although low coverage in some cases
