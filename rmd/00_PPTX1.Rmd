## Purpose

To present a summary of fisheries data reported by CPCs present at the workshop (Eastern region)

## Contents:

- summary of data status
- Active fishing vessels
- New fishery code - example
- Availability of annual retained catch
- Availability of geo-reference catch and effort
- Availability of size frequency

## summary of data status

•	The tuna fisheries of Eastern CPCs caught about 998,000 t of IOTC species in 2022, representing 48.69% of the total IOTC catch.
•	The industrial fisheries from the CPCs present, represent only 29.32% of the total catch in the Eastern Indian Ocean.
•	Fisheries are of various type, with mainly coastal fisheries, although not all CPCs report information for the coastal fisheries
•	Information on industrial vessels are available in details. Whereby, mainly longliners are operating in the Eastern Indian, both deep-freezing, and fresh longline vessels
•	Spatial catches are well available for industrial fisheries
•	Spatial catches for coastal fisheries are either not provided or low coverage in some cases, with only 19.84% of total retained catches.

## summary of data status...CONT

•	Spatial catches for the industrial longline are more representative of the retained catches reported for longline, although not all CPCs reported raised spatial catch.
•	Spatial catches for the industrial purse seine, on the other hand, are far less representative of the retained catches reported for longline, at 4.75% of the total catch purse seine catch reported.
•	Spatial catch and effort information of small scale fisheries, particularly handline and coastal longline indicated that fisheries operated beyond their national jurisdiction
•	Size frequency data are available for several fisheries, although low coverage in some cases
