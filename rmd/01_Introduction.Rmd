# Introduction

The work of the Data Section of the IOTC Secretariat includes managing and curating the data submitted by CPCs, providing support for data reporting, and verifying, preparing, and analysing fisheries datasets and reports. These activities support the Working Parties and Scientific Committee meetings and contribute to the dissemination of information on the Secretariat's data-related work.

The Data Section also provides technical assistance to strengthen CPCs' capacity to improve the quality of the fisheries data they report, in accordance with the data-reporting resolutions of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). Support to CPCs is provided upon request, with the Secretariat proactively engaging with CPCs that face challenges identified by the Scientific Committee. This includes direct requests for assistance from CPCs as well as requests from the scientific Working Parties, aligned with the workplan and priorities aimed at improving data related to specific Working Parties.

This document provides an overview of the Data Section's activities for the year 2025, along with updates on data-related requests from other Working Parties and progress on recommendations from last Working Party on Data Collection and Statistics (WPDCS20).
