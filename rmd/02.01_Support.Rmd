## Virtual Technical meetings

Providing support to CPCs is crucial for enhancing the quality of data used for assessments. In 2025, the section conducted four technical meetings with CPCs, in webinar. The data section also participated in data-related meetings, primarily online, to stay updated on developments across various domains of the fisheries sector. Details of the technical meetings, categorised by type and date, are provided in [Appendix I](#AppDataSectionActivities).

The objective of the technical meetings was to review the issues identified with the quality of data submitted by the CPCs and in some instances, assess progress of the ongoing work of catch re-estimation.
