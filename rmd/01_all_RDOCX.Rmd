# SUMMARY

- The tuna fisheries of Eastern CPCs caught about `r pn(rt(RC_EST_SUM[YEAR == 2022, sum(CATCH)]))` t of IOTC species in 2022, representing `r round(((RC_EST_ALL[YEAR == 2022 & FLEET_CODE %in% c("CHN", "LKA", "IND", "IDN", "THA", "MYS", "MDV", "PAK"), sum(CATCH)])/(RC_EST_ALL[YEAR == 2022, sum(CATCH)])*100),2)`% of the total IOTC catch.

- The industrial fisheries from the CPCs present, represent only `r round(((RC_EST_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & FISHERY_TYPE_CODE == "IND", sum(CATCH)])/(RC_EST_SUM[YEAR == 2022, sum(CATCH)])*100),2)`% of the total catch in the Eastern Indian Ocean.
:::

::::
::: {}
- Fisheries are of various type, with mainly coastal fisheries, although not all CPCs report information for the coastal fisheries

- Information on industrial vessels are available in details. Whereby, mainly longliners are operating in the Eastern Indian, both deep-freezing, and fresh longline vessels
:::

:::{}
- Spatial catches are well available for industrial fisheries
 
- Spatial catches for coastal fisheries are either not provided or low coverage in some cases, with only `r round((((CA_RAW_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & FISHERY_TYPE_CODE =="ART", sum(CATCH)])/(RC_RAW_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & FISHERY_TYPE_CODE =="ART", sum(CATCH)]))*100),2)`% of total retained catches.
:::

::::
:::{}
- Spatial catches for the industrial longline are more representative of the retained catches reported for longline, although not all CPCs reported raised spatial catch.

- Spatial catches for the industrial purse seine, on the other hand, are far less representative of the retained catches reported for longline, at `r round((((CA_RAW_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & GEAR_CODE =="PS", sum(CATCH)])/(RC_EST_SUM[YEAR == 2022 & GEAR_CODE =="PS", sum(CATCH)]))*100),2)`% of the total catch purse seine catch reported. 
:::

:::{}
- Spatial catch and effort information of small scale fisheries, particularly handline and coastal longline indicated that fisheries operated beyond their national jurisdiction 

- Size frequency data are available for several fisheries, although low coverage in some cases
