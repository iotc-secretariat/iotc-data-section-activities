# Conclusions

The recommendations from WPDCS20 meeting were thoroughly reviewed by SC27, with most being endorsed or sent for further consideration by S29. Requests made to WPDCS from various Working Parties primarily focused on the Secretariat collaborating closely with CPCs to review and improve data collection practices.

In 2025, the data section carried out several activities, particularly capacity-development with countries consistent data reporting gaps, aimed at improving the quality of data reporting. Notably, many capacity-development missions required follow-up actions to monitor the progress made by the CPCs.

<!-- CPCs such as Indonesia, with complex fisheries, require continuous support, while coastal African countries, where tuna fisheries are not as prominent, are challenging, as limited efforts and resources are allocated to improving data collection practices. -->
