# Data Requests from Scientific Meetings

To improve the quality and availability of data for stock assessments of IOTC species, the Working Parties made specific requests to the WPDCS to provide or improve certain data. In many instances, this involves liaising directly with CPCs to fulfil these requests. The Data Section occasionally needs to initiate specific projects or develop specialised formats to request data. However, not all CPCs are willing to provide the required information. In addition to the Working Parties, the SC may also submit follow-up requests to the WPDCS. During the most recent SC session and subsequent Working Parties, 16 data-related requests were made (see **[Appendix 2](#Requests)**).
